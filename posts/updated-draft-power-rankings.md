The Direwolves took over as the number one ranked team in the power rankings through round 16. With the help of five first place votes, the Direwolves received an astounding 21 extra votes since the week 8 rankings. Bringing up the rear was a new franchise, the Herbert St Hermits, who finished with the lowest amount of votes, including the second largest drop in votes (17). The previously top-ranked Goathouse Alums finished only 5 votes out from keeping his spot on top, while finishing with 5 first place votes. The power rankings will be updated after round 24.
